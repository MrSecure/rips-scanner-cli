	- added vulnerability type 'LDAP Injection'
	- fixed bug with wrong detection of user defined securing functions using for-loops
	- fixed critical bug with wrong detection of securing during inter-procedual analysis

RIPS 0.33:
----------
	Code analysis:
	- added vulnerability type 'XPath Injection'
	- implemented $F_INSECURING_STRING (list of functions like urldecode() that can re-taint already sanitized data) 
	- fixed bug with $GLOBALS[] (ignore previous local vars, accept only global vars)
	- improved tainted $_SESSION (=global var) handling
	- fixed bug with tainting functions not displayed in the result tree
	- fixed bug with differently used quotes in array['"parameter'"] during traceback
	- added compact() support
	- ignore upper/lowercase in function names because PHP does not (sYsTem())
	- scan for dynamic function calls $variable() (possible code exec)
	
	Interface:
	- added missing taint-highlighting in the first line of PVF tree
	- added file list: listing all scanned files and includes
	- added list of function calls to each list item of user-defined functions
	- added help button for simple visualization, description, example, PoC, patch and securing function list in a new window
	- RIPS warns you when scan may last very long (counts files to scan)
	- added AJAX interface with scan animation
	- added scan result statistics and graphs
	- highlight variables onMouseOver in code viewer and scan result. persistent highlight onClick.
	- code viewer now supports active jumping between function calls and declarations 
		(click on function call to jump to declaration, click "return" to jump back to the call)
	- added regex search function 
	- windows are now resizeable
	- added curl headers for all tainting $_SERVER parameters in the exploit creator

RIPS 0.32:
----------
	Code analysis:
	- rebuild PVF config (FILE, CODE and SYSTEM PVF into FILE_READ, FILE_AFFECT, FILE_INCLUDE and EXEC PVF)
	- added $_SERVER parameters that are tainting to the config (example: $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];)
	- fixed bug with securing detection of global string securing functions (example: md5($a.$b);)
	- fixed bug where the first token of an included file was ignored
	
	Interface:
	- added a little howto to the welcome page
	- added more detailed vulnerability types to scan for
	- added vulnerability name to each find (name still present during minimization of output block)
	- added .phps-tainted-var for highlighting tainting vars in the trace output
	- added explaination to inter-procedual analysis results
	- added RIPS logo (created by Gareth Heyes, thank you)
	- added a option to change the output tree from bottom-up to top-down (requested by Joel, thank you)
	- fixed bug with missing link by inter-procedual analysis when function name appeared in the "requires" list

RIPS 0.31:
----------
	Code analysis:
	- improved RIPS code + performance 
		(http://code.google.com/speed/articles/optimizing-php.html)
		(http://www.wmtips.com/php/tips-optimizing-php-code.htm)
	- improved securing detection by detecting automatic type casts	
	- added connection poisoning PVFs
	- added support for $arrays{'a'} with curly braces
	- added missing support for tainted OO function with XSS
	- added a missing class-to-variable association when using a constructor call instead the keyword 'new'
	- fixed bug where successful file inclusions were scanned again for a file inclusion vulnerability
	- fixed bugs with detecting commands written over several code lines (reported by Stefan Esser & Pragmatk)
		(patch does not solve all multi-line bugs)
	- corrected analysis of variables marked as 'global'	
	
	Interface:
	- better arranged user input list
	- added option to highlight variables in the CodeViewer by click
	- added vulnerability type "All" to scan client- and server-side vulns simultaneously
